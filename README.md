# Stasis Theory


A. Conjecture - Virtual Advisor for Civil Engineering Majors: a website that allows civil engineering students to plan their four years of courses at the University of Pittsburgh.

B. Definition - Students can become confused with major requirements or with what classes would best fit their goals - advising appointments are not efficiant for quick answers or to answer concerns. Pitt provides the necessary resources, yet they are not easy to find and are spread throughout different website pages. 

C. Quality - This site allows students to track their degree requirements through a checklist that contains all required courses. Course descriptions are offered for each selection, in addition to several lists of electives required by the civil engineering program. A sample schedule gives students a visual example as to the workload they should expect during each term, and the appropiate order of courses that must be taken. Lastly, the website provides a second checklist that tracks the requirements towards a specific concentration that is listed on student degrees.

D. Policy - The site is would be listed on the main page of mypitt.edu, or in student center. To maintain the purpose of the project, it would be easy to locate and access by all students. This version only covers the civil engineering department, but the code may be expanded to fit any other desired department. 

# Version/Project History

Version 1: Base code is obtained from a previous GitHub project. No changes have been made to the code, it is only transferred into Brackets and made ready to edit.

Version 2: Base code of several HTML files are edited to fit the needs of the newer version. The formatting is altered, several new functions are added, and new descriptions detail the website functions. Buttons populate the checklist, each taking the user to the appropiate link/PDF.

Version 3: The website contains two additional pages: an introductory page the user will see first, and a page that centers around course concentrations. One page that details each course is deleted and merged with the checklist page. Format fixes are made to the existing pages.

Final Version: The formatting is changed further, while the style of the website is enhanced. 

# Job Roles/Descriptions

Developers: All members developed code, as each member covered a specific task. One member created the lists of courses, another added descriptions to those courses, and the last member created the sample schedule. Formatting fixes were made by the corresponding team member, while one team member handled the styling.

Document Writers: All team members assisted in writng the necessary documentation show here. Each member also aided in developing the project pitch page, with one member being responsible for the coding of that page.

Presenters: Each member participated in the presentation, while one member provided a demo to the audience. 

Testing: Each member was responsible for testing their portion of code, and made fixes if needed.
