A. Conjecture - Virtual Advisor for Civil Engineering Majors: a website that allows civil engineering students to plan their four years of courses at the University of Pittsburgh.

B. Definition - Students can become confused with major requirements or with what classes would best fit their goals - advising appointments are not efficiant for quick answers or to answer concerns. Pitt provides the necessary resources, yet they are not easy to find and are spread throughout different website pages. 

C. Quality - This site allows students to track their degree requirements through a checklist that contains all required courses. Course descriptions are offered for each selection, in addition to several lists of electives required by the civil engineering program. A sample schedule gives students a visual example as to the workload they should expect during each term, and the appropiate order of courses that must be taken. Lastly, the website provides a second checklist that tracks the requirements towards a specific concentration that is listed on student degrees.

D. Policy - The site is would be listed on the main page of mypitt.edu, or in student center. To maintain the purpose of the project, it would be easy to locate and access by all students. This version only covers the civil engineering department, but the code may be expanded to fit any other desired department.
